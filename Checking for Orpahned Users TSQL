After migrating firstly user logins then DB 
Check for orpahned users.

SELECT dp.type_desc, dp.sid, dp.name AS user_name  
FROM sys.database_principals AS dp  
LEFT JOIN sys.server_principals AS sp  
    ON dp.sid = sp.sid  
WHERE sp.sid IS NULL  
    AND dp.authentication_type_desc = 'INSTANCE';  


If an orphan is present - check for logs to see if they are using anything:

---Script for audit log reading
select * from fn_get_audit_file ('E:\Audit_Files\*.sqlaudit', default, default)
where session_server_principal_name = 'amosinv'
ORDER BY event_time DESC
go

DROP user orphan_user
