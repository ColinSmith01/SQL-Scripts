-- Check Database backup history
-- changing the dates range that you seek in, changing getdate () -1 for any value that you want to see, f.e getdate () - 100 will return last 100 backupts 
-- After WHERE, you can add "AND" f.e. "AND database_name = 'database name'" to see results only for particular database
-- checking particular type of backup, replacing D (full backup) with L (log backup) or I (differential backup)
